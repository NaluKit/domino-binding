/**
 * Registration objects returned when an event handler is bound (e.g. via {@link
 * org.gwtproject.event.shared.EventBus#addHandler}), used to deregister.
 *
 * <p>To use {@code com.google.web.bindery.event.shared.HandlerRegistration} or {@code
 * com.google.gwt.event.shared.HandlerRegistration} in a context where a {@code
 * org.gwtproject.web.bindery.event.shared.HandlerRegistration} is needed, or the reverse, use
 * {@code handlerRegistration::removeHandler}.
 *
 * <p>A tip: to make a handler deregister itself try something like the following:
 *
 * <pre>new MyHandler() {
 *  HandlerRegistration reg = MyEvent.register(eventBus, this);
 *
 *  public void onMyThing(MyEvent event) {
 *    // do your thing
 *    reg.removeHandler();
 *  }
 * };
 * </pre>

   * attached to the event source. If the handler is no longer attached to the event source, this is
